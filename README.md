To create a `README.md` file for your project, you'll want to include essential information that helps users understand what your project is about, how to set it up, and how to use it. Below is a comprehensive `README.md` that you can copy and paste into a file named `README.md` in your project's root directory.

# E-commerce Order Management System API

This project provides a FastAPI-based API for managing e-commerce orders, products, and order statistics. It connects to a MySQL database to persist data.

## Features

* **Order Management**: Create, retrieve, and update orders.
* **Product Management**: Retrieve product listings.
* **Order Statistics**: Get aggregate statistics on orders, including daily totals.
* **Database Integration**: Connects to MySQL with proper transaction management for order creation to ensure data consistency.
* **Pagination**: Supports pagination for listing orders and products.
* **Robust Error Handling**: Provides meaningful error messages for various scenarios like insufficient stock, invalid inputs, and database errors.

## Technologies Used

* **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
* **Pydantic**: Used for data validation and settings management with Python type hints.
* **MySQL Connector/Python**: The official MySQL driver for Python.
* **python-dotenv**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
* **MySQL**: Relational database for storing application data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.7+
* pip (Python package installer)
* MySQL Server

### 1. Database Setup

First, you need to set up your MySQL database.

1.  **Connect to MySQL**: Open your MySQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench, command-line client).
2.  **Run the SQL script**: Execute the `database_setup.sql` file to create the `ecommerce_test` database and its tables.

    ```bash
    mysql -u your_user -p < database_setup.sql
    ```
    (Replace `your_user` with your MySQL username. You will be prompted for your password.)

    Alternatively, you can manually execute the commands within `database_setup.sql` in your MySQL client.

### 2. Project Setup

1.  **Clone the repository** (if applicable):

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file if you haven't already. You can generate one using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing the necessary libraries.)

    The required libraries are:
    * `fastapi`
    * `uvicorn` (for running the FastAPI app)
    * `pydantic`
    * `python-dotenv`
    * `mysql-connector-python`

4.  **Create a `.env` file**:

    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of your project and add your database connection details:

    ```
    DB_HOST=localhost
    DB_NAME=ecommerce_test
    DB_USER=root
    DB_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    ```
    Replace `your_mysql_password` with your actual MySQL root password or the password of the user you configured.

### 3. Running the Application

To start the FastAPI application, use Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
````

The `--reload` flag enables live-reloading, so the server will automatically restart when you make changes to the code.

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### API Documentation

Once the server is running, you can access the interactive API documentation (powered by Swagger UI) at:

  * **Swagger UI**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
  * **ReDoc**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

These interfaces allow you to explore the available endpoints, their expected inputs, and sample responses.

## API Endpoints

Here's a quick overview of the main API endpoints:

  * **`GET /api/orders`**: Get a paginated list of all orders.
  * **`GET /api/orders/{order_id}`**: Get details of a specific order by ID.
  * **`POST /api/orders`**: Create a new order. Requires `user_id` and a list of `items` (each with `product_id` and `quantity`). This endpoint handles stock deduction and ensures data integrity through transactions.
  * **`PUT /api/orders/{order_id}/status`**: Update the status of an existing order.
  * **`GET /api/orders/stats`**: Get aggregate order statistics (total orders, total amount, today's orders, today's amount).
  * **`GET /api/products`**: Get a paginated list of active products.
